A **modern, lightweight, and fully client-side Task Manager** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, focusing on **clean UX, smooth animations, and correct state management** — without any frameworks.

This project demonstrates **real-world frontend engineering practices**, including controlled animations, persistent storage, inline editing, undo actions, and time-based task expiry.

## Project Overview

**Smart Task Manager** is a feature-rich to-do application that prioritizes:

- ✨ User Experience
- 🧠 Correct state handling
- 🎯 Minimal yet powerful UI
- ⚡ Zero dependencies

It is **not a beginner CRUD app** — instead, it showcases how a real-world app behaves with **isolated animations, undo functionality, and persistent state**.

## Live Features

### 🟢 Task Creation
- Add tasks using button click or `Enter` key
- First letter auto-capitalized
- Button disabled when input is empty

### 🟢 Task Completion
- Custom animated checkbox
- Smooth visual feedback on completion
- Strike-through styling with fade effect

### 🟢 Inline Editing
- Double-click any task to edit
- `Enter` → Save
- `Escape` / Blur → Cancel

### 🟢 Delete with Undo
- Smooth delete animation
- Undo toast appears for **5 seconds**
- Task restored if undo is clicked

### 🟢 Task Expiry System
- Tasks older than **24 hours** automatically move to **Expired Zone**
- Expired tasks can be restored with one click

### 🟢 Persistent Storage
- All tasks saved in `localStorage`
- Data survives page refresh and browser restart

## UX & Design Philosophy

This app follows **real product UX rules**:

- ❌ No list blinking on re-render
- ✅ Only affected items animate
- ❌ No accidental empty submissions
- ✅ Keyboard-friendly interactions
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy

Animations are **intentional**, not decorative.

## Core Functionalities Explained

### ➕ Add Task Flow
1. User types task
2. Button activates dynamically
3. Task object created with timestamp
4. State updated → UI re-rendered
5. Only new task animates

---

### ✔ Toggle Completion
- Task state updated immutably
- Only toggled task pulses
- No full list re-animation

---

### ✏ Inline Edit System
- Replaces task text with input field
- Preserves task ID and timestamp
- Ensures clean cancel/save logic

---

### 🗑 Delete with Undo
- Task visually fades out
- Temporarily stored in memory
- Toast provides recovery window

---

## Animation Architecture (Important)

**Problem Solved:**  
Preventing full list animation on every re-render.

**Solution Used:**
- No default animation on `<li>`
- Animation classes applied conditionally:
  - `animate-in` → new task
  - `animate-check` → toggled task
- Animation flags reset after render

This mirrors **React-style diffing behavior**, achieved manually.

---

## Data Persistence

- Uses browser `localStorage`
- Stores complete task objects
- No backend required
- Safe JSON serialization

---

## Edge Cases Handled

✔ Empty input submission  
✔ Rapid add/delete actions  
✔ Undo timeout cleanup  
✔ Editing with empty value  
✔ Checkbox + edit conflicts  
✔ Expired task restoration
